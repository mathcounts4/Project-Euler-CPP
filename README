makefiles are meant to be magical:
just "make myMain.cpp" and it should figure out the rest
This also runs the generated executable.
To only build and link, run "make myMain.cpp l" or "make myMain.cpp link".
In addition, "make" will use the last main file target.

See test/tProjectEuler.cpp for examples on how to use this library to solve Project Euler problems with a tiny amount of boilerplate.

Calling the Project Euler wrapper PE::run_problem:
ProjectEuler.hpp

Helper math classes include:
BigInt
Fraction
Mod
Point
Polynomial
PrimeUtils.hpp
Rational (Fraction<BigInt>)
SafeMath

Displaying a percent tracker for slow programs:
ProgressUtils.hpp

Displaying floating-point with particular precision utility:
