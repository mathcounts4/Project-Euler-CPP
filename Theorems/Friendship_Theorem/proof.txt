Let n=|V|.

First, we show that each vertex must have an even number of neighbors:
For any vertex S and neighbor X, there must be a common neighbor Y, making SX, SY, and XY all connected.
This also makes X a common neighbor of S and Y, and S a common neighbor of X and Y.
Therefore no other vertex can be a neighbor to more than 1 of {S,X,Y}, so any other neighbor of S cannot be a neighbor of X or Y.
All neighbors of S can be grouped into these connected pairs ({X,Y} is one such pair), and since the number of neightbors of S is finite (since n is finite), it must be even.

Now we handle trivial case n=1:
There is only 1 graph for n=1, and it satisfies the condition that there is someone who is neighbors with everyone else.

From now on, we assume n>1.

Since n>1, each vertex must have at least one neighbor, since there exists another vertex for which we need to share a common neighbor.


We show that, if any vertex has at least 4 neighbors but is not friends with everyone else, that the graph must have an infinite number of vertices, through an infinitely repeating bowtie pattern:

A     B-----E
|\   /|
| \ / |
|  S  |
| / \ |
|/   \|
C     D

An infinite number of vertices contradicts that the graph is finite.

Why is "any vertex has at least 4 neighbors but is not friends with everyone else" sufficient?
Otherwise, either (A) there is a vertex that is friends with everyone else (satisfying the theorem), or (B) every vertex has <4 neighbors.
Since every vertex has at least one neighbor, and an even number of neighbors, this means that every vertex has 2 neighbors.

By the theorem condition, every vertex pair shares exactly one neighbor so:
∀S ∑_{X∈adj(S)} |adj(X)|-1 = n-1
Note the -1 within the sum excluding S itself from being counted when looking at neighbors of neighbors of S, and -1 on the right to exclude S when counting pairs of vertices {S,?}.
Summing over all S, we get:
∑_{S∈V} ∑_{X∈adj(S)} |adj(X)|-1 = n*(n-1)
∑_{S,X∈V, SX∈Edges} |adj(X)|-1 = n*(n-1)
∑_{X∈V} ∑_{S∈adj(X)} |adj(X)|-1 = n*(n-1)
∑_{X∈V} |adj(X)|*(|adj(X)|-1) = n*(n-1)

If every vertex has 2 neighbors:
∑_{X∈V} 2*(2-1) = n*(n-1)
n*2 = n*(n-1)
n = 3.

When n=3 and each vertex has 2 neighbors, each vertex is neighbors with all the others, so the theorem statement holds.


So now, what's this infinite number of vertices via infinite number of bowties argument?

We assume that there is a vertex S with at least 4 neighbors, but is not neighbors with every other node - namely, there is a vertex E where SE∉Edges.
Since S and E must have a common neighbor, call this B, so we have:
S-----B-----E
Since neighbors come in pairs (see earlier argument), there exists a D neighbors with S and B:

   B-----E
  /|
 / |
S  |
 \ |
  \|
   D

Since S has at least 4 neighbors, we pick an arbitrary other one A, and its pair partner C:

A     B-----E
|\   /|
| \ / |
|  S  |
| / \ |
|/   \|
C     D

E can only be neighbors with 1 of S's neighbors (other than B), otherwise S and E would have multiple neighbors in common.
In addition, E is not neighbors with S.
Thus E's only neighbors must all be a distance of 2 from S, except B.

In addition, looking at any vertex X that is a distance of 2 from S, X can only share 1 neighbor Y with S - we consider X as "belonging" to Y.
In this way, E "belongs" to B (when looking at S).

This is our initial bowtie - centered at S, with pairs AC and BD, and extension BE where E isn't neighbors with anyone else in the bowtie.


Now we show the existence of another bowtie, centered at B:

E has a partner with respect to B, which belongs to B. Call this F.

A     B-----E

| \ / | \   |

E must have a common neighbor with A, which belongs to A. Call this G.

G must have a partner with respect to A, which belongs to A. Call this H.

      | / \ |   \ |
      |/   \|    \|
      C     D     F

H must have a common partner with B, which belongs to B.
This cannot be E, since GH would have 2 common neighbors: A and E.
This cannot be F, since HE would have 2 common neighbors: G and F.
Call this I.

We construct an infinite sequence of nodes {A_i} such that the following invariants hold:
1. A_i has at least 4 neighbors
2. A_{i+1} and A_{i+2} are neighbors
3. ∀j≤i A_j and A_{i+2} are not neighbors


Base case: we define A_1, A_2, and A_3, and show the invariants hold for i=1.
By assumption, there is a node with 4 neighbors (call it X) that is not friends with all other nodes (say, Z, where XZ is not an edge).
Let Y be the common neighbor to X and Z, so XY and YZ are neighbors, while XZ are not.

Setting A_1 = X, A_2 = Y, and A_3 = Z, we verify the invariants for i=1:
(1) A_1=X has at least 4 neighbors (holds by assumption)
(2) A_2=Y and A_3=Z are neighbors (holds by construction of Y)
(3) ∀j≤1 A_j and A_{3}=Z are not neighbors (holds by definition of Z, and the only such j is j=1 with A_j=A_1=X

Inductive step:
Assume sequence satisfies those invariants for some i=k, k≥1.
Show that the sequence satisfies those invariants for i=k+1.
Calling A_{k} = S, A_{k+1} = B, A_{k+2} = E, we construct the bowtie:

G

A     B-----E
|\   /|\    |
| \ / | \   |
|  S  |  \  |
| / \ |   \ |
|/   \|    \|
C     D     F

Letting A_{k+3} = G, show that induction holds.
In particular, we must show:
(1) A_{k+1}=B has at least 4 neighbors
(2) A_{k+2}=E and A_{k+3}=G are neighbors
(3) ∀j≤k+1 A_j and A_{k+3}=G are not neighbors

(1) holds as B has at least 4 neighbors by way of two non-paired neighbors (S and E), and each neighbor must be paired.
(2) holds as EG are neighbors by G's construction.
(3)
Since G belongs to A, BG cannot be neighbors, so A_{k+1}=B and A_{k+3}=G are not neighbors, so the invariant holds for j=k+1.
Now we need only show the invariant ∀j≤k.
By inductive hypothesis, ∀j≤k A_j and A_{k+2}=E are not neighbors
Suppose the invariant failed, so ∃j≤k where A_j and A_{k+3}=G are neighbors. Let J = A_j for this specific j.
Then GJ are neighbors, while EJ are not.
...?


Now we have an infinite sequence of nodes {A_i} such that:
1. A_i has at least 4 neighbors
2. A_{i+1} and A_{i+2} are neighbors
3. ∀j≤i A_j and A_{i+2} are not neighbors

How does this show we have an infinite number of nodes?
Consider any two nodes in the sequence: A_x, A_y, where x<y.
x≥1 so y≥2, and y-1≥1 makes i=y-1 valid for the conditions above.
Then we have that A_y and A_{y+1} are neighbors by (2) with i=y-1, but A_x and A_{y+1} are not neighbors by (3) with i=y-1,j=x.
A_x = A_y would be a contradiction, since this would require the node to be neighbors with and not neighbors with A_{y+1}.
Thus A_x ≠ A_y, so all nodes in the sequence are distinct.
Thus the infinite sequence of nodes -> an infinite number of nodes.
Since the original statement said the graph was finite, this is a contradiction.

Thus the existence of a node with at least 4 neighbors -> there exists a node that is neighbors with all the others.
