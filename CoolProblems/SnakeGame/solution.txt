Divide the squares per player (which player could possibly ever play on each square) by a parity argument (based on the location of the first move).
If it's player X's turn and the board can be (partially or completely) tiled with dominos such that all of player X's squares are covered, player X loses.
Player Y's strategy is to choose the other square in the domino from player X's move, thus Y always has a valid move.

This means, for an MxN board, if either M or N are even, the second player wins.
If M and N are both odd, the first player can win by selecting one of the majority squares as the first move (and would lose by selecting one of the minority squares).
