This is a 2-player impartial game.

The states are a list of piles sizes (all positive integers).

The valid moves are:
* remove any positive number of objects from a single pile
* if the "end state" hasn't been declared yet, declare the "end state": deciding between:
  * when there are no remaining piles, the person whose move it is loses
  * when there are no remaining piles, the person whose move it is wins

Describe:
* the set of losing positions

Prove:
* any winning state has a move that reaches a losing state
* from any losing state, any valid move reaches a winning state
