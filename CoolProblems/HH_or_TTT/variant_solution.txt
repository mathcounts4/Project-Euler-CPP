Consider the progress along both sequences, and where you end up when failing to continue along the current path of progress.

HTTTH fails as:
T (overall progress: nothing)
HH (overall progress: H)
HTH (overall progress: HTH)
HTTH (overall progress: H)
HTTTT (overall progress: nothing)

HTHTH fails as:
T (overall progress: nothing)
HH (overall progress: H)
HTT (overall progress: HTT)
HTHH (overall progress: H)
HTHTT (overall progress: HTT)

We can draw the states of progress towards either goal, and draw back-edges on the failure flips.
From HT, we consider the probabilities of 3 results:
1. get to HTTTH
2. get to HTHTH
3. cycle back to nothing, H, or HT

(1) is 1/8 (direct) + 1/32 (HTHTTTH)
(2) is 1/8 (direct)
(3) is everything else

Since (3) is just resetting the game, we can take the ratio of (1) and (2) to be their overall ratio after running the game infinitely.
This is 5:4.

Therefore:
HTTTH has p = 5/9
HTHTH has p = 4/9

Intuitively, HTHTH can fail onto the HTTTH path, but not the other way around, making HTTTH slightly more likely.
