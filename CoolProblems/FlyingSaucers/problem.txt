Note: this problem is from Mathematical Puzzles by Peter Winkler, page xlvi.

8 men and 5 women live in a house.
An alien abducts these people according to the following strategy:
* a spaceship visits the house, and picks a random person to board
* the spaceship keeps choosing a random person from the house to board, until it picks a person of the opposite gender (if so, this person is left behind), or the house is empty
* the spaceship leaves with all the people on board, and returns to the house empty
* the spaceship repeats this process until the house is empty

What is the probability that the last person to leave the house is a woman?
