You and your friend are playing a game with the devil.
Before the game, you and your friend may discuss a strategy, but you cannot communicate in any way during the game.

The game:

1. You enter a room with the Devil, where he has set up a labeled chessboard.
On each square of the board is a fair coin, heads or tails.
The coins could all be heads, all be tails, or some mix.

2. The Devil points to one particular square, call it X.

3. You MUST pick exactly one coin and flip it to the other side.

4. You leave the room.

5. Your friend enters the room and can view the chessboard and the coins on it.

6. Your friend picks one square (trying to identify X).

7. If your friend picks X, you each get $1,000,000. Otherwise, you or your friend are killed at random, with any life insurance policy specifically excluding death-by-Devil.

What strategy can you and your friend choose to maximize your probability of winning?

Noe that the Devil can listen to your strategy, and choose which coins are heads vs tails, and X, in order to attempt to counteract your strategy.

Rather than 64 labeled squares, how does the answer change when you have n (positive integer) labeled squares, and why?
